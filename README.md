# Asynchronous Error Handling in Express.js Route Handlers
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications when dealing with asynchronous operations, specifically database queries, within route handlers.  The error arises from attempting to access variables declared within the asynchronous operation's scope from outside that scope.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches a user from a database. If the user is not found, it correctly returns a 404 error. However, if the user is found, it attempts to send the `user` object in the response. The problem is that the `user` variable might not be defined yet because the database query is asynchronous. This leads to a runtime error.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle this situation.  The solution uses the `async/await` syntax to ensure that the `user` variable is defined before it's used. The code is now structured to correctly handle the asynchronous nature of the database query. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `npm install express`.
4. Run `node bug.js` to see the original error.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version.

## Learning Points
* Understand asynchronous operations in JavaScript (Node.js).
* Correctly handle asynchronous operations within Express.js route handlers.
* Learn the usage of `async/await` for better error handling and code readability.
